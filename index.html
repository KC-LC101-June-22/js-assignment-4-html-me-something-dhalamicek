       <h2>&#9733 Tri Talk</h2>
       <ul>
         <h3><li>Disciplines</li></h3>

         <h3><li>Distances</li></h3>
               <p>Per USA Triathlon, below are the categories and their associated distances (in miles) for triathlons.  Races that have two disciplines falling within the distances of a triathlon category, use that name.  If all three discipline distances are in different categories, generally the bike distance is used to name the distance category.<br>
                  <br>Per World Triathlon, there are four race distances (in meters or kilometers). These are indicated below with *.

               <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">Triathlon can be an individual race (one person completes all three disciplines), a relay team (2-3 people complete 1-2 disciplines), or an assisted athlete team (an individual with disabilities, generally physical, is pushed or pulled using adaptive equipment by another person(s) through all three disciplines.<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cecilia-niemann-triathlon-wins-cerebral-palsy-_n_3600112">Click here to read an article about a local KC assisted triathlete</a></p>
            <h3><li>Jargon and Acronym Meanings</li></h3>

                     <li>Wetsuit Legal: USAT rules state that competitors may wear wetsuits if the water temperature is 78 degrees or lower. USAT rules also state that if the water temperature is between 78.1 to 83.9 degrees, competitors may wear wetsuits but will not be eligible for awards.</li>
                     <li>Time Trial Start: Participants line up for the swim based on the average swim time per 100 meters and are sent off to start the swim individually or in groups of 2-3 every 3-5 seconds.</li>
                     <li>Wave Start: Participants start the swim in groups, often based on age, gender, and/or race distance.</li>
