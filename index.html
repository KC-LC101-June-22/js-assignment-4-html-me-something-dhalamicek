      <p>About the Author: Debbie Niemann is an independent local age grouper triathlete with over a decade of triathlon training and racing experience.  She has participated in more than 50 triathlons across the country of all distances.  Debbie is a 2X Ironman and has been an All World Athlete (AWA.)  Debbie's biggest passion was breaking down barriers for people with disabilities to race in triathlons.  She was the first in the metro, state, and region to complete a triathlon with an assisted athlete, and the first woman in the country to do so doing all three disciplines.  Her passion comes from her and her family's love of the sport and her daughter, Cecilia, who had cerebral palsy.  Cecilia was a local celebrity in the triathlon community and broke down barriers, preconceived notions, and stereotypes.  Through racing in over 20 triathlons and her bright, cheery smile, she won the hearts and admiration of many and forever improved inclusion in the sport and metro.</p>
